## Software Testing Study Notes

### Important terms

**SDLC** - software development lifecycle.

#### Importance of SW Testing

1. Ensuring Quality and Reliability
   Throughly tested software ➡️ saves time and money.

2. Improving User Experience(UX)
   To create software that is easy to navigate and use.

3. Strong Security
   To find vulnerabilities in the software.

4. Ensuring Regulatory Requirements
   To ensure that software follows safety and security standards.

**Integration testing** - how well different components work together;
**System testing** - if a software includes all requirements;
**End-to-end Testing** - makes sure that everything works as intended;
**Performance testing** - if a system manages different levels of usage;
**Security testing** - if there are any potential vulnerabilities.

**Software systems**

**Multiple interconnected components:** Many parts that depend on each other(payment system, inventory system).

**Diverse technologies:** Uses different languages, tools, frameworks or platforms.

**Complex integrations:** Parts must work together across systems or services(API, db, cloud platforms - third-party).

#### Testing Stretegies

**Test automation:** Using tools/scripts to run tests automatically instead of manually.

✔️ Advantages:
Faster testing;
Fewer human errors;
Repeatable and reliable;
Saves time and cost;

➖ Drawbacks of test automation:
High initial setup cost
Maintenance effort when tests break
Not suitable for all tests (e.g., exploratory testing)

**Risk-based testing:**
A testing approach that prioritizes testing based on the risk and impact of potential failures, focusing more on high-risk areas first.

**Strategic resource allocation** - optimization of tool use, training programs for testers.

**Continuous monitoring and feedback**
